<p>I graduated from <em>Federal University of Technology Akure</em> with a <em><strong>first class degree</strong></em> in <em>Metallurgical and Materials Engineeering</em>. I have the necessary academic background and research skills to be a competent contributor to a research team.
  Also, skills gained through proffessional Management and Risk course training complement my success has an Entreprenuer.</p>
<p>My experience researching and writing my undergraduate and online free access publications has helped me develop the skills required in an ideal researcher.</p>

  <h3>EDUCATION</h3>
<p><em>Federal University of Technology Akure.</em> <br /><strong>Bachelor of Engineeering in Metallurgical and Materials Engineeering <br /> First Class (Division) Dec.2019<br />Thesis:</strong>Development of Pawpaw Strand/Glass Fiber Hybrid Reinforced Epoxy Composites for Structural Application.<br />The research was carried out to produce composites suitable for electronics and automobliles applications. Chemical treatment was carried out to modify the surface morphology of the fiber. The composites were then produced by incorporating the fibers in the polymer matrix. The mechanical properties, wear and water absorption tests carried out on the samples showed that all the properties were enhanced by the reinforcements. The reinforcement content with optimum value was 6 wt.%.</p>
